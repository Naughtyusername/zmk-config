* TODO Tasks

** [ ] Implement 'sticky layer' that is active until a specific key (e.g., Space) is pressed
this is less useful to us unless we do smart macros that allow us to go to the layer and hit 2.5 and have the space there (or any keys we decide to be escape codes)
this does seem to be possible in base zmk just requires some macro magic, urob has some tools that could help but urobs stuff isnt always easy to implement so pass for now.
** [ ] Implement a combo for one-shot layers (`&osl`) to improve layer access
** [ ] Implement Combo for Layer Toggling (`&tg`) or Turning On (`&to`)
   - **Goal:** Enable semi-permanent layer switching using key combos, similar to QMK's `TO()` or `TG()`.
   - **Details:** Define a combo (e.g., `ZA`) that, when pressed, switches to a specific layer (e.g., `GAMING`) until explicitly exited.
** [ ] Finalize QMK wrapper porting
   - [X] Review and update comments in `config/wrappers.dtsi` to be ZMK-specific.
** [X] Populate `___SOFLE_THUMBS_...___` macros for sofle keyboard
update: for now most sofle thumb keys unless explictly set otherwise will act as modifier keys but one shot mods or sk keys, so we can hold them if desired but otherwise
just tapping them will chain the sequence
     this is so low priority for me because ill never use the majority of keys, however
     i think i will set the sofle up as the main gaming keyboard, might as well,
     so with that in mind we can put the extra keys to better use, probably add a second gaming layer too (not just the roguelike layer, but something different like i used to have. as well as full mod keys available)
** [ ] Port Missing QMK Features
   - [ ] **Per-Key Tapping Term:** Your QMK config uses a longer tapping term for weaker pinky fingers.
     - To port this, create new `hold-tap` behaviors in `config/behaviors.dtsi` (e.g., `hml_pinky`) with a longer `tapping-term-ms` (e.g., 185).
     - Apply this new behavior to the pinky home-row keys (`A`, `;`) in `config/wrappers.dtsi`.
   - [X] Ensure '::' and '->' macros are accessible/used in wrappers; remove '..=' macro.
** [ ] Add combo to return to BASE layer (on second gaming layer and roguelike layer).
** [ ] Utilize One-Shot Key Modifier Combos on the ROGUELIKE layer.

* DONE Tasks

** [X] Set up 'B' and 'N' as tap-preferred layer keys for LOWER and RAISE respectively (Opposite-Hands Rule)
** [X] Add '.' key to LOWER layer for easier numeric input (e.g., "2.5").
** [X] Explore One-Shot Mods (`&sk`) in Combos
** [X] Implement top-row mirrored GACS one-shot modifier combos
** [X] Add combo for single quote (e.g., 'nm') for faster comment/sentence writing.
** [X] Fix timing values to match QMK configuration.
** [X] Implement programming combos for auto-pairing brackets and operators.
** [X] Fix Sofle display widgets build error for the right-hand side.
** [X] Finalize QMK wrapper porting
   - [X] Implement `ADJUST` layer functionality.
   - [X] Adapt the `BLANK_TEMPLATE` to ZMK conventions.
** [X] Define thumb key layouts
   - [X] Populate `___SWEEP_THUMBS_...___` macros for cradio/sweep keyboard.
** [X] Port Missing QMK Features
   - [X] **One-Shot Mods on Thumbs:** Your QMK thumb clusters use One-Shot Mods extensively. This is a major ergonomic feature to port.
   - [X] **"J + K" Combo for Escape:** Your QMK config uses `J+K` for `Escape` (Vim style).
   - [X] **Advanced Home Row Mod Tuning:** Your QMK config uses `PERMISSIVE_HOLD`, `SPECULATIVE_HOLD`, and `FLOW_TAP_TERM` for a very specific feel. A direct 1:1 port is not possible, but you can approximate it.
** [X] Define encoder behavior (Migrated to flexible sensor_rot_kp)
   - [X] Investigate migrating from `&inc_dec_kp` to the more flexible `&sensor_rotate` behavior. (COMPLETED - implemented `sensor_rot_kp` behavior in `config/behaviors.dtsi` and updated wrapper macros in `config/wrappers.dtsi`)
   - [X] Customize encoder behavior for each layer. (COMPLETED - now possible by overriding `sensor-bindings` in keymap layers using `&sensor_rot_kp`)
** [X] Implement advanced layer management
   - [X] **Sticky Layers (&sk):** Configure sticky layers for momentary layer access.
   - [X] Conditional/Tri-Layers: Set up a "tri-layer" that activates when both `LOWER` and `RAISE` layers are active. (COMPLETED by Gemini CLI)
   - [X] **Long-press for ADJUST layer:**
** [X] Add new combos and tap-dances
   - [X] **Combos (QMK's "Chordal"):**
** [X] Implement Advanced Key Behaviors
   - [X] **Fix `CAPS_WORD` interaction with Tap Dance keys (`TD_Q_ESC`)**
   - [X] **Smart Key Repeat:** Add key repeat to home-row mods. This allows a letter to repeat on a double-tap-and-hold, which is not possible with a standard hold-tap.
** [X] Configure Sofle Hardware
   - [X] **Add status widgets to OLED:** The `sofle.conf` file currently enables the display but is missing the required flags for useful widgets. Add the following flags to enable them:
   - [X] **Add WPM widget to OLED:**
   - [X] Add RGB underglow support to indicate the current layer.
** [X] Integrate external modules
   - [-] **`zmk-tri-state`:**
** [X] Explore advanced ZMK behaviors (QMK Equivalents)
    - [X] **`CAPS WORD`:** Add `CONFIG_ZMK_CAPS_WORD=y` and a keybinding for it.
    - [X] **Dynamic Macros:** Investigate and enable `CONFIG_ZMK_MACRO_DYNAMIC=y` for on-the-fly macro recording.
    - [X] **Speculative Hold:** Use the `hold-while-undecided` property in hold-tap behaviors to reduce modifier lag.
    - [X] **Permissive Hold:** Use the `"balanced"` flavor for hold-tap behaviors for a more responsive feel for fast typists.
    - [X] **Per-key Tapping Term:** Use the `tapping-term-ms` property on specific hold-tap bindings that need a custom value.
    - [X] **Numword (Smart Layers):** Implement behavior where the layer stays active only while typing numbers, deactivating on space/letter.
    - [X] **Mod-Morphs (Contextual Keys):** Expand usage beyond `bs_del`, e.g., smart dot ('.', '..', '/'), grave escape ('Esc' to '`' when GUI is held).
** [X] Configure BIOS/Bootloader Compatibility (NKRO)
   - [X] NOTE: ZMK defaults to 6KRO, which is safe for BIOS. Enabling NKRO (`CONFIG_ZMK_HID_REPORT_TYPE_NKRO=y`) improves OS performance but may break BIOS compatibility.
   - [X] NOTE: Unlike QMK, there is no runtime keybinding to toggle between 6KRO and NKRO. The mode is set at compile time. QMK's `NK_TOGG` keycode is not directly portable.
   - [X] DECISION: Decide whether to enable NKRO by default and test for BIOS compatibility.
   - [X] ACTION: Add `CONFIG_ZMK_HID_REPORT_TYPE_NKRO=y` to the `.conf` files if NKRO is desired.
** [X] Merge `wrappertest` branch
** [X] ZMK Studio Integration
